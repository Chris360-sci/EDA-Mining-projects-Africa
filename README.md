# EDA-Mining-projects-Africa
What is the purpose of the project?

The purpose of this task was to identify the most abundant commodities, and reveal which commodities are mined in each country. It also looks at the energy sources used by mines in different regions of Africa, and looks at the relationships between the abundance of a commodity and the amount of years a mine will operate for, as well as the amount of energy needed to operate the mine.

What data was analyzed?

I analyzed a dataset on the Africa Power Mining Projects, which is available from the World Bank's data repository.

How was the data analyzed?

The data is analyzed using code stored in a jupyter notebook. It is analyzed using functions from libraries including numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplot lib and networkx.

What are the main findings?

The EDA revealed which commodities are most commonly mined, most abundant, and which countries mine them. It also gave insight into the most energy intensive commodities and the types of energy used for mining in the different regions. Lastly it revealed a positive relationship between the abundance of a commodity and both the amount of years a mine will operate for and the energy needed to operate the mine.
